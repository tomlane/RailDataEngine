# RailDataEngine

This is my monolithic codebase of my endevours with open rail data. Things to note:

- I'm not the most experienced developer in the world. But the code probably shows that.
- Somethings such as the domain library and "data" projects may be more useful than the others. 

MIT licensed and open to PRs, if anyone is up for it.
